# stealth-game-with-machine-learning
The AI-Based Stealth Spy Game is a Python prototype in which the player must navigate a grid-based environment without being detected by AI-controlled guards. Rather than relying on fixed patrol routes, these guards adapt over time by:  Predicting the player’s next moves via a lightweight supervised model (e.g., decision tree) trained on past play sequences.  Re-routing patrols toward player “hotspots” discovered through unsupervised clustering of historical positions.  Reacting in real time to line-of-sight or noise distractions (e.g., thrown rocks) via simple heuristics.  Players can move in four directions and create distractions. Guards switch between patrol, prediction-biased movement, and direct chase modes, with a growing “suspicion level” that decays if no further cues are detected. The entire game runs either in a terminal window (using curses or print updates) or a minimal Pygame interface, emphasizing clean AI logic over graphical complexity.
